## README

This github repository is designed as a cookbook and reference for projects that need to be written in multiple programming languages. It contains a simple dataset and code in R and Python (sklearn) that will output equivalent results.

The code is available for use under the BSD 3.0 license, and references have been hyperlinked and listed at the end of the corresponding README files. Code comments and descriptions also have been added to elucidate concepts that may be unclear or require additional context, however, an in-depth explanation of Machine Learning and its concepts is beyond the scope of this repository.
